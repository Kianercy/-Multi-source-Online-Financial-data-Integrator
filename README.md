# Multi-source-Online-Financial-data-Integrator
The Python script aggregates financial and economic data from Yahoo Finance API, World Bank Open Data, and Google Cloud's BigQuery. It empowers users, including investors and analysts, with seamless access to historical stock data, country-specific economic indicators, and diverse public datasets.
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use the provided code to fetch data from Yahoo Finance API, World Bank Open Data, and Google Cloud public datasets using Python:

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas google-cloud-bigquery requests
This will install the required libraries for data manipulation (pandas), Google Cloud's BigQuery client (google-cloud-bigquery), and requests for making HTTP requests.

Step 2: Set Up Google Cloud Credentials
If you plan to use Google Cloud's BigQuery, ensure you have a Google Cloud account and set up the necessary credentials. You can follow the official documentation on getting started with authentication.

Step 3: Modify the Code for Your Use Case
Open the provided Python script in a code editor. Modify the script based on your specific use case:

Update the get_yahoo_finance_data function parameters to specify the stock symbol (symbol), start date (start_date), and end date (end_date) for fetching data from Yahoo Finance.
Update the get_world_bank_data function parameters to specify the economic indicator (indicator), country code (country_code), start date (start_date), and end date (end_date) for fetching data from World Bank Open Data.
Adjust the bigquery_query variable to contain a valid BigQuery SQL query based on your specific requirements and the available public datasets.
Step 4: Run the Script
Save the modified script and run it using a Python interpreter. You can run the script from the command line or within your preferred Python development environment.

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Step 5: Review the Results
The script will fetch data from Yahoo Finance API, World Bank Open Data, and Google Cloud BigQuery. The results will be printed to the console. Review the output to ensure that data is being retrieved correctly.

Note:
Make sure you have an active internet connection to fetch data from APIs.
If you encounter any issues with the Google Cloud BigQuery part, double-check your credentials and ensure that the BigQuery API is enabled for your Google Cloud project.
By following these steps, you can use the provided code to integrate data from Yahoo Finance API, World Bank Open Data, and Google Cloud public datasets in a step-by-step manner based on your specific data requirements.
